# Project: Build a Custom Embedded Linux Distribution for a Smart Home Gateway

## Project Description
Create a custom Linux distribution for a **Smart Home Gateway** device that connects to local Wi-Fi, controls smart devices over Bluetooth, ZigBee and Z-Wave, provides a touchscreen interface, and logs sensor data to the cloud.

---

<!-- ## Why this project?

- It targets **real hardware** (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4 or BeagleBone Black).
- It needs **custom images**, **Wi-Fi support**, **Bluetooth/MQTT libraries**, and **device drivers**.
- It can be extended with **systemd services**, **user applications**, and **SDKs**.
- It reflects a realistic embedded Linux product. -->

### Part 1: Introduction
- Why you need Yocto.

### Part 2: Environment Setup
- Set up your host to build for ARM-based hardware.
- Choose Raspberry Pi 4 as the target device.

### Part 3: Building a Base Image
- Build and test `core-image-minimal`.

### Part 4: Running in QEMU
- Emulate the Smart Gateway UI app or MQTT logging functions before testing on real hardware.

### Part 5: Supporting Real Hardware
- Add `meta-raspberrypi` and configure it for Raspberry Pi 4.
- Include touch display support if needed.

### Part 6: Creating Your Own Layer
- Create `meta-smarthub` layer to house app code, scripts, and settings.

### Part 7: Writing a Custom Image
- Create `core-image-smarthub.bb` to install the hub software, MQTT client, and a UI.

### Part 8: Adding Wi-Fi Support
- Enable `wpa-supplicant`, include firmware, and auto-connect to a known network.

### Part 9: Advanced Customization
- Add Bluetooth or ZigBee support via recipes.
- Add `mosquitto` or `paho-mqtt` client for MQTT messaging.
- Include a Python Flask or Qt-based touchscreen UI.

### Part 10: Debugging and Troubleshooting
- Solve missing firmware, recipe errors, or service startup failures.

### Part 11: Resources and Next Steps
- Export an SDK for external app developers.
- Use Yocto in CI for image builds and OTA update testing.
- Polish for production: reduce image size, secure boot, license audit.
